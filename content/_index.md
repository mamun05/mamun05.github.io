I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science, Purdue University. My research interest is in the area of Database Systems+Machine Learning (ML): "ML for Systems" and "Systems for ML". 


## Research

My current research is in the area of "ML for Systems", particularly focusing on Learned Multi- and High-dimensional Index Structures. Previously, I was involved in a research project on In-Memory Graph-Relational Data Systems. Additionally, I conducted research on Anomaly Detection from sensor data streams during my graduate studies at Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada.
