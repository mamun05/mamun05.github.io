I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science, Purdue University. My advisor is Professor [Walid G. Aref](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/faculty/aref.html). Moreover, I had research collaboration with Professor [Jianguo Wang](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/csjgwang/). My research interest is in the area of Database Systems + Machine Learning (ML): "ML for Systems" and "Systems for ML".

## Research

My current research is in the area of "ML for Systems", particularly focusing on Learned Multi- and High-dimensional Index Structures. Previously, I was involved in a research project on In-Memory Graph-Relational Data Systems. Additionally, I conducted research on Anomaly Detection from sensor data streams during my graduate studies (advised by Professor [Antonina Kolokolova](https://www.cs.mun.ca/~kol/)) at Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada.
