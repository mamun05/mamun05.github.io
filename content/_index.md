Julian Straub is a Research Scientist at [Meta Reality Labs Research](https://tech.facebook.com/reality-labs/) (RLR) working on Computer Vision and 3D Perception. 
Before joining RLR, Julian obtained his PhD on [Nonparametric Directional Perception](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/112029/1006379939-MIT.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) 
from [MIT](https://www.mit.edu), where he was advised by [John W. Fisher III](https://sli.csail.mit.edu/people/johnfisher) and
[John Leonard](https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/JLEONARD@MIT.EDU) within the [CS and AI Laboratory](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) (CSAIL). 
On his way to MIT, Julian graduated from the [Technische Universität München](https://www.tum.de) (TUM) and the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu) with a M.Sc. 
He did his Diploma thesis in [Eckehard Steinbach](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/steinbach-eckehard)'s group with the [NavVis](https://www.navvis.com) founding team and in particular with [Sebastian Hilsenbeck](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=TenY_v0AAAAJ). At Georgia Tech Julian had the pleasure to work with [Frank Daellart](https://dellaert.github.io)'s group.

## Research

My current research interests are problems that involve 3D localization, recognition and description of all objects and surfaces from egocentric video streams in scalable and generalizable ways. 

Here are some recent invited talks:

- ICCV 2025 OpenSUN3D Workshop ([slides](/download/straub_2025_ICCV_OpenSUN3D_slides.pdf))
- CVPR 2025 Point Cloud Tutorial ([page](https://sites.google.com/view/cvpr25-point-cloud-tutorial))
- ECCV 2024 Spatial AI Workshop ([slides](/download/efm3d_eccv_2024_spatialai_workshop.pdf))
- ECCV 2024 Egocentric Research Tutorial with Project Aria ([talk](https://youtu.be/m6oFLfYUpoM?t=7036&si=FuRExHOku6peIGd3))
