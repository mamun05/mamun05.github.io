I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science, Purdue University. My research interest is in the area of Database Systems+Machine Learning (ML): "ML for Systems" and "Systems for ML". My current research is in the area of "ML for Systems", particularly focusing on Learned Multi- and High-dimensional Index Structures. Previously, I was involved in a research project on In-Memory Graph-Relational Data Systems. Additionally, I conducted research on Anomaly Detection from sensor data streams during my graduate studies at Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada.

## Research

My current research interests are problems that involve 3D localization, recognition and description of all objects and surfaces from egocentric video streams in scalable and generalizable ways. 

Here are some recent invited talks:
